    <p>Despite earlier announcements, Open Knowledge International have decided not to run OKFestival 2018. There have been some recent major changes in the organisation that have adversely affected our ability to produce a Festival which would match the expectations of our networks and partners.</p>
<p>We are, obviously, disappointed by this decision but we hope to take the time to look at the concept of OKFestival and develop it so that it returns as an event that is relevant to the open knowledge movement and the people who are so integral to its work. We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the organisation of OKFestival so far and look forward to working with you in the future.</p>
<p>Work is continuing on a rescaled, more targeted event to gather our network together and to collaborate on active themes which can move the organisation and the Open Knowledge Network forward together. Further news on this event can be found <a href="https://blog.okfn.org/2017/11/30/open-knowledge-summit2018/">on the Open Knowledge International blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Is there going to be a Festival in 2019?</h3>
<p>The organisation is looking at the way forward on this and it is hoped that there will be an event which will meet the requirements of the Open Knowledge communities in 2019.</p>
<h3>What is the Open Knowledge Summit?</h3>
<p>We are looking forward to bringing our Open Knowledge Chapters, groups, and partners together at an Open Knowledge Summit event in Thessaloniki in May 2018 that will help us all collaboratively build the future of the Open Knowledge Network.
